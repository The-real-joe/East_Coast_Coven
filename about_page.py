st.write("Enter the Veil of Eternal Night. To all vampires and donors of the East Coast—this sanctuary calls to you. Our coven is a gathering place for those bound by the ancient allure of darkness. Here, in the shadows, we come together to explore the secrets of the night, to find our strength in its depth, and to embrace the power that lies beyond the veil of mortal understanding. We are a community of kindred souls, drawn together by an unspoken bond—a fascination with the mysteries that dwell in the unknown. We are a haven for those who seek more than the ordinary, who desire to tap into the ancient wisdom and energy that flows beneath the surface of the world. In the stillness of the night, we shed our earthly forms and uncover the hidden truths that the light conceals. Our coven is a space for self-expression, creativity, and discovery, where every member contributes to the ever-growing tapestry of the eternal. Here, we empower one another through connection, knowledge, and the shared thrill of the arcane. If you are called by the darkness, if you seek to unravel the secrets of the night, join us. Let us walk the shadowed path together, and awaken to the power that lies within.")
